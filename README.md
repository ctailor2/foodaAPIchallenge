### The API
Each 3rd party application that is registered under a 'developer' account is granted a Fooda API key. This key must be passed in on the header of all HTTP requests to the API in order to access API resources.

Requested API resources are returned as JSON.

**Data Content Type:** application/json
**Base Url:** http://localhost:3000/api/v1

## API Endpoints

POST /users/auth

Upon successful authentication, user login state is captured via a cookie that is exchanged between client and server on each subsequent user-related request.

Example usage:
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Token token="secret"' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3000/api/v1/users/auth -d '{ "username" : "ctailor2", "password" : "password" }' -c ~/Desktop/cookies.txt
````

**User Restaurants**

GET /users/restaurants

Returns a list of restaurants that the user has purchased from, accessible via the key "users".
